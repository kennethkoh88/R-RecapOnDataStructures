# MacDonald_Hypothesis_Test
One sample t-test using MacDonald's datasets

McDonald has developed a new drive-through process. They hoped that the new process can reduce their drive-through service time. 

It has tried out the new process in 25 stores. 

In past, McDonaldâ€™s had a mean service time of 174.22 seconds.

The new mean service time is 159.02 seconds. 

Does McDonald have the evidence to show that the new process is better than the previous process?

Did the reduction of time just happen by chance/luck (random) ?
